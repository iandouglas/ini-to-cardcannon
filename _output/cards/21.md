As any kind of user on the system
When I visit an item's show page from the items catalog
My URI route is something like "/items/18"
I see all information for this item, including:
- the name of the item
- the description of the item
- a larger image of the item
- the merchant name who sells the item
- how many of the item the merchant has in stock
- the merchant's current price for the item
- an average amount of time it takes this merchant to fulfill this item
If I am a visitor or regular user, I also see a link to add this item to my cart
