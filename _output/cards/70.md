## Merchant Order Fulfillment
Merchants must "fulfill" each ordered item for users. They will visit an order show page which will allow them to mark each item as fulfilled. Once every merchant marks their items for an order as "fulfilled" then the whole order switches its status to "completed". Merchants cannot fulfill items in an order if they do not have enough inventory in stock. If a user cancels an order after a merchant has fulfilled an item, the quantity of that item is returned to the merchant.
### Admin functionality
Admins can fulfill items in an order on behalf of a merchant.
