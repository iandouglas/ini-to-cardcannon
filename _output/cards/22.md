## User Profile Page
When a user who is not a merchant nor an admin logs into the system, they are taken to a profile page under a route of "/profile".
### Admins can act on behalf of users
Admin users can access a namespaced route of "/admin/users" to see an index page  of all non-merchant/non-admin users, and from there see each user. This will allow the admin to perform every action on a user's account that the user themselves can perform. Admin users can also "upgrade" a user account to become a merchant account.
