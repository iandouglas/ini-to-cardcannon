```
As a visitor
When I visit a Merchant Items Index page
Then I see a link to add a new item for that merchant
When I click the link
I am taken to '/merchants/:merchant_id/items/new' where I see a form to add a new item
When I fill in the form with the item's:
- name
- price
- description
- image
- inventory
Then a `POST` request is sent to '/merchants/:merchant_id/items',
a new item is created for that merchant,
that item has a status of 'active',
and I am redirected to the Merchant Items Index page where I see the new item
```
