```
As a visitor
When I visit an Item Show page
Then I see a link to change the Item's active status
Active items should have the link "deactivate"
Inactive items should have the link "activate"
When I click the link
Then a 'PATCH' request is sent to '/items/:id/activate' or 'items/:id/deactivate' (depending on the link)
and I am redirected to the Item Show page where I see the active status has been toggled
```
