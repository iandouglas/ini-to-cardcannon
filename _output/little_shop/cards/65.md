```
As an admin user
If I visit a profile page for a user, but that user is a merchant
Then I am redirected to the appropriate merchant dashboard page.
eg, if I visit "/admin/users/7" but that user is a merchant
Then I am redirected to "/admin/merchants/7"
And I see their merchant dashboard page
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 51, Admin User Profile Page
