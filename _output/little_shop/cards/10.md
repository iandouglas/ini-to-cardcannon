```
As a visitor
When I click on the 'register' link in the nav bar
Then I am on the user registration page
And I see a form where I input the following data:
- my name
- my street address
- my city
- my state
- my zip code
- my email address
- my preferred password
- a confirmation field for my password

When I fill in this form completely,
And with a unique email address not already in the system
My details are saved in the database
Then I am logged in as a registered user
I am taken to my profile page ("/profile")
I see a flash message indicating that I am now registered and logged in
```
