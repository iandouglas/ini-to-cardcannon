## Merchant Dashboard
This is the landing page when a merchant logs in. Here, they will see their contact information (but cannot change it), some statistics, and a list of pending orders that require the merchant's attention.

### Admins can act on behalf of merchants
Admin users will see more information on the "/merchants" route that all users see. For example, on this page, an admin user can navigate to each merchant's dashboard under a route like "/admin/merchants/7". This will allow the admin to perform every action that the merchant themselves can perform. Admin users can also "downgrade" a merchant account to become a user account.
