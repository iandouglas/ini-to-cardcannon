```
As a merchant
When I visit my items page
And I click the edit button or link next to any item
Then I am taken to a form similar to the 'new item' form
My URI route will be "/dashboard/items/15/edit" (if the item's ID was 15)
The form is re-populated with all of this item's information
I can change any information, but all of the rules for adding a new item still apply:
- name and description cannot be blank
- price cannot be less than $0.00
- inventory must be 0 or greater

When I submit the form
I am taken back to my items page
I see a flash message indicating my item is updated
I see the item's new information on the page, and it maintains its previous enabled/disabled state
If I left the image field blank, I see a placeholder image for the thumbnail
```
