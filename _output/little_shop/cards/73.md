As an admin user
When I visit the user index page
I see a "disable" button next to any users who are not yet disabled
I see an "enable" button next to any users whose accounts are disabled.
If I click on a "disable" button for an enabled user
I am returned to the admin's user index page
And I see a flash message that the user's account is now disabled
And I see that the user's account is now disabled
