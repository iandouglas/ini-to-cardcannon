```
As a registered user
When I visit my profile page
I see a link to edit my profile data
When I click on the link to edit my profile data
Then my current URI route is "/profile/edit"
I see a form like the registration page
The form contains all of my user information
The password fields are blank and can be left blank
I can change any or all of the information
When I submit the form
Then I am returned to my profile page
And I see a flash message telling me that my data is updated
And I see my updated information
```
