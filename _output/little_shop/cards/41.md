```
As an admin user
When I log into my dashboard, "/admin/dashboard"
Then I see any "packaged" orders ready to ship.
Next to each order I see a button to "ship" the order.
When I click that button for an order, the status of that order changes to "shipped"
And the user can no longer "cancel" the order.
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 31, All Merchants fulfill items on an order
