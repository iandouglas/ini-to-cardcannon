story_text: ## Merchant Items
    Merchants need CRUD functionality for items in the database. These stories will work through the management of items. These routes should be namespaced like "/dashboard/items" and "/dashboard/items/6" and so on. Merchants can disable items so they are no longer for sale but stay in the database so orders are still handled properly. Merchants can fully delete items if nobody has ever ordered it.
    NEWLINE
    ### Admin functionality
    Admin users share all management functionality, but the routes will be much longer, like "/admin/merchants/8/items" and "/admin/merchants/8/items/6" and so on.
